<p>Slökās 1 to 16: Gangā Dēvī&rsquo;s obeisance to the poets who influenced her.</p>
<ol>
<li>May the elephant-faced God, who, like the divine Kalpavrksa fulfils ihe desires of those that sur render to His Grace, be propitious to the good.</li>
<li>For the sake of wisdom, I prayerfully approach God Śiva and His Spouse, who embody the light of Universal Consciousness and who bear the form of the Creator&rsquo;s model for making man and woman.</li>
<li>I make obeisance to Goddess Saraswati who lives in the lotus-like mouths of great poets, as a Sārika bird in a jewelled cage and who acts like mcon light on the ocean of Universal Intelligence.</li>
<li>I bow to Guru Kriyāśakti, unparalleled in wisdom and resplendent with auspiciousness like another Triloçana (Śiva) with Sarvamangalā (Pār vati) shining (by his side).</li>
<li>May the sage Vālmiki, who is (as it were) the first foot set on this earth by poesy, bring cheerfulness to the minds of the virtuous.</li>
<li>Just as there is delicious juice in every joint of red sugar-cane, there is sweet essence in every sec tion of Vyāsä&rsquo;s string of expressions (the Mahābhārata)<br>
M ADHURA VIJAY A Îv
which imparts immediate enjoyment to men of good taste.
even no</li>
<li>Who are the poets that do not play the role of a slave to Kālidāsa? For even now those that are, live by his ideas.</li>
<li>How could others comprehend the eloquence of Bhatta Bāna, which captivates like the musical sound of the viņā played by Saraswati&rsquo;s own hand?</li>
<li>Just as the garland of vakula flowers yields its sweet fragrance oniy when pressed, so too, the language of Bhāravi discloses its excellence and gives delight to the learned only if pondered upon.</li>
<li>The flourish of expressions of Açārya Dandin, drunk (as it were) with the wealth of nectar, shines like the fashionable precious stone-mirror of the Creator&rsquo;s Spouse.</li>
<li>I fancy that Bhavabhūti&rsquo;s compositions must be some species of Kāmadhēnu; for they produce in the ears of the learned a pleasure akin to the drinking of ambrosia.</li>
<li>Whom would the expressions of the poet of Karnāmệta fail to delight&ndash;expressions which are an ocean of honey flowing from the flower clusters of the mandāra tree?</li>
<li>Even as the thirsty cāköra birds love to drink the mai&rsquo;s of the moon, poets find immense relish in the composition of Kavi Tikkayya.</li>
<li>Breathes there the man of learning who will not be jealous of the poet Agastya whose wealth of learning is demonstrated by the production of as many as seventyfour poetic compositions?</li>
<li>We respectfully greet the great poet Gangā dhara as a second Vyāsa, in that he has made the story of the Bhārata actually seen by the device of dramatization.</li>
<li>May the lord of poets, Visvanātha, flourish long; for it is by his grace, even in individuals like my self, has dawned a sense of omniscience.</li>
</ol>
<p>Shlokās 17 to 24: Ganga Dēvi un-literary criticism.</p>
<ol start="17">
<li>There is sense in some, idea in some, and sen timent in some; but nowhere is found a worl: where a!! these exist together.</li>
<li>Even as a single sait particle from an oyster shell spoils the liquid essence of black sandal, so too, even the smallest Aaw found in a poetie work render&rsquo;s it censurable.</li>
<li>Just as an ugly woman, though virtuous, is not pleasing to her husband, a faultless poetic compo sition, if devoid of qualities (fineness), does not satisfy the man of learning.</li>
<li>A vile man searches for faults in a poetic composition, in disregard of its merits, even as the crow shows a preference to the nimba (fruit) without caring for the mango in the forest.</li>
<li>How long can a plagiarist dally with poesy obtained by stealing? For shortlived is the radiance of artificial colouring in a fictitious stone.</li>
<li>Logicians, there are many; grammarians—they abound in thousands; but scarcely can be found poets who are charming by reason of their beautiful songs.</li>
<li>What is there that the composition of a poet does not yield? It promotes fame, serves for wealth, destroys baseness and awakens delight.</li>
<li>A connoisseur of learning needs no invitation to listen to good poetry. Who urges the bee to taste the sweetness of honey?</li>
</ol>
<p>Slokas 25 to 42: The greatness of Bukka, the father of Kampaņa, is described.</p>
<ol start="25">
<li>Oh learned men, please listen, therefore, to this poem of mine dealing with the history of king Kampaņa, going by the famous title of the Conquest of Madhurā (Madhurā Vijayam).</li>
<li>There was a fainous king called Bukka who was the younger brother of Harihara and whose com mands were borne on their heads by all the neighbour ing vassals.</li>
<li>Like Sēșa among serpents, Himavān among mountains, and Visņu among gods, he occupied the first place among the lords of the earth.</li>
<li>Severer than the sun and pleasanter than the moon was he. In depth he excelled the ocean, and in firmness, the mountain Sumēru.</li>
<li>With discernment alone for his minister, and the bow alone for his army, he counted on his arms as his only ally in the heart of battle.</li>
<li>He demonstrated the presence of the (four) guardian deities of the universe even on this earth: Indra by being victorious, Varuna by being the over lord of the waters, Kubēra by giving away wealth and Yama by being impartial.</li>
<li>His immense fame displayed its existence among his subjects as sandal paste on their chests, as pearl ear-rings in their ears, and camphor powder on their faces.</li>
<li>By (the might of) his arm which confounded the army generals of his enemies, fame was won by him, even as nectar (by the gods) by using the Man thara mountain with which was churned the boundless lord of the rivers (viz., ocean).</li>
<li>His fame, as a person of delightful qualities, spread so envelopingly that it appeared like a coverlet of white silk on the oval shape of the universe.</li>
<li>The sword wielded by his hand, terrible as it looked, feasting on the life-breath of his royal oppo nents, begot glory, even as a ferocious serpent feeding on air produces its cover of slough.</li>
<li>His right hand which to all appearance seemed to be drawing the sword was in fact practising the art of drawing, by her braided hair, the goddess of prosperity of his adversaries.</li>
<li>Having, after a long time, come to him who was ever wakeful in protecting this universe, Goddess Lakşmi never again remembered Vișnu who was in sensible, wrapped up in yogic sleep.</li>
<li>The tree of Dharma which had withered away by the scorching heat of this Kali age sprouted again by the water that flowed (from his hands) while making gifts of charity.</li>
<li>His very enemy-kings who bore on their head scars caused by rubbing against his foot-rest stood on all quarters as so many pillars of his triumph.</li>
<li>The reputations of his adversaries, as if they were enveloped by rows of flames of the fire of his prowess, looked dark in appearance.</li>
<li>Chained in the grounds of his halls, his vic torious elephants looked like clouds, imprisoned, be cause they stood in the way of his triumphal expeditions.</li>
<li>The (cloud of) dust raised by the hoofs of his war-horses made the sun apprehensive of an unexpect edly sudden approach of Rāhu.</li>
<li>By the side of his prosperity, the prosperity of Kubēra or Indra looked insignificant; and far remote became the question of any comparison between the fortunes of personages like Duryodhana and him.</li>

<p>Shlokas 43 to 66: The City of Vijayanagar.<br>
43. He who augmented his riches by conquest, had the famous Vijayanagara for his capital city. That city won the approbation of knowing men, as Indra&rsquo;s Amarāvati, won that of the gods.<br>
44. As if in rivalry with the heavenly Ganges that flowed round the borders of swargaloka, the river Tungabhadra encircled the city as a formidable moat.<br>
45. The city was also surrounded by ramparts on all sides which were high as the Cakrāçala mountains; and it had the beauty of a water-trench round the creeper Lakşmi and looked like the navel of goddess Earth.<br>
46. Lofty and gem-set towers like the peaks of the Sumēru emitting rainbow colours adorned the city.<br>
47. The city was also surrounded by pleasure groves which looked like abodes of Spring and which were full of flowering trees like campaka, asőka, nāga and kēsara.<br>
48. The pleasure-hillocks in the city were fre quented by the musk deer that sought the shade of the plantains and karpūra plants in them. These hillocks looked like the veritable hiding places of the God of Love.<br>
49. The city had sporting-lakes, fragrant with the smell of lotuses. Those lakes had gem-set steps and were always inhabited by beautiful swans.<br>
50. The elevated portions of the city had high built palaces which were white like the clouds of autumn. One wondered if they were so many shapes which the fame of the king&rsquo;s conquest of world-cities itself had taken.<br>
51. The city looked like the stage set for flowering female beauty to display its charms; or it may even be pictured as the mark of fashion and loveliness adorning the forehead of the lady known as Earth&rsquo;s Southern Quarter.<br>
52. The city was full of virtuous Brāhmans, and armies of musicians ever strode its expansive grounds. Thus, like the full-moon night, or the world of celestial bards, serenity and music reigned unceasingly all round.<br>
53. Bhujangas, or youths of fashion, made that city their favourite haunt, even as bhujangas, or serpents, make the crown of Śiva their chosen abode. Good-hearted people in large numbers loved to wander in its precincts like gods in the regions of the Sumēru.<br>
54. The city was the play-ground of all good fortune. Prosperity in all its aspects delighted to live in its saloons. The city looked like a garland of precious stones on the shores of the sea of virtue.<br>
55. The disc of the sun caught in the heights of the city&rsquo;s palaces produced on the on-lookers the illu sion of a golden jar.<br>
56. The damsels playing on the grounds of the top floor of the city&rsquo;s mansions often laid their hands on the rounded body of the moon, mistaking it for their play-ball of pearls.<br>
57. Hearing the sound of the drum accompanying the music played in the city&rsquo;s palaces, the peacock began to dance even in the absence of any appropriate &lsquo;occa sion (viz., the appearance of a thunder-cloud).<br>
58. The clouds that hung about the sides of the city&rsquo;s palaces with the colour of padmarāga gems reflect ed in them, always looked brown like evening clouds.<br>
59. The clouds of smoke that rushed through the crevices in the buildings of the city at the evening-time appeared like darkness effecting its escape afraid of be ing caught in the effulgence of approaching lamp-light inside.
60. As the lustre of the gems with which the steps were paved in the lakes always drove darkness away, the cakravāka birds were not separated even at night fall.<br>
61. The moonas if ashamed by reason of the shin ing beauty marking the lotus-like faces of the lovely women in the city, ever wore a mourning black on her body known as kalanka.<br>
62. The god of love never thought of resorting to his flower-arrows to effect his conquests in the face of the lovely glances shot from the eyes of beautiful women there to subdue the hearts of youth.<br>
63. As if to take their lessons in graceful walking the swans ever sought the company of women there, attracted by the sweet jingling of their foot-ornaments.<br>
64. The blooming breasts of the maidens of the city were beautifully set off by their slender waists even as thick clouds in the void above.<br>
65. There was no hardness there in the city ex cept in the breasts of beautiful damsels, nor crooked ness except in their curly locks, nor thinness except in their waists.<br>
66. Pampā was the branch city of Vijaya. Many a Kubēra (lords of wealth) were there so much so that God Virūpākṣa (Śiva) who was enshrined there never spent a thought about his original home at Alaka.</p>
<p>Slökās 67 to 75: Bukka as king. Of special interest is the mention of Devīyi, the queen of Bukka.</p>
<ol start="67">
<li>Installed in that city, he, of undiminished prowess, ruled over the earth even as Indra ruled the heavenly regions from his seat in Amarāvati.</li>
<li>By contemplating on his prosperity that was at the service of friends, and his politics that was wide and comprehensive, his subjects imagined that Manu himself had in him his second birth.</li>
<li>Though impartial to all the three puruşārtas dharma, artha and kāma—the king, who was the idol of all virtuous people, had a special regard for dharma, even as Vişnu, the Lord of all, has for satva, among his three guņas&ndash;satva, rajas and tamas.</li>
<li>His hand gave freely, his ear heard the Sāstras well, his head was always crowned with the sandals of Lord Siva. The sense of decorative fineness that he thereby evinced became the means of his achieving his desire to get and keep prosperity.</li>
<li>The kings that ruled over the territories of which the mountains of Vindhya, Malaya, Astha and Rõhana were the four boundaries paid homage to him and those that were enemies shook with fear.</li>
<li>Always awake at his post of guarding the kingdom that came to him from his ancestors in an unbroken line of succession, the king enjoyed the immense pleasures befitting his royal rank yet with complete detachment.</li>
<li>Like Lakşmi to Nārāyana and Pārvati to Sankara, queen Devāyi was to the king the chosen consort.</li>
<li>Though the king had other wives also, she alone became the object of his love and regard, even as Rõhiņi to the moon among celestial luminaries.</li>
<li>The brave king who was pleasing like the full moon to the eyes of the people of Karnāța dwelt along at the city of Vijaya and enjoyed the delights of his youth with her who was his heart&rsquo;s beloved.</li>

<p>Slökäs 1 to 13: Queen Devāyi conceives. Her longings during pregnancy are described.</p>
<ol>
<li>The queen conceived by the king and bore in her womb, the seed of royal race, as the cosmic waters held in them the tējas virile of Brahma with which the three worlds were created.</li>
<li>The queen put aside her jewels. Her face was somewhat pale like the sara reed and her form unusually slender. She shone like a river in autumn with lotuses gone and with the globe of the moon reflected on its watery surface.</li>
<li>She who was the beloved consort of the lord of this earth, indulged in tasting particles of it as if to teach the responsibility of earth-sway to the infant in her womb.</li>
<li>The very nature of her longings in her pregnancy which always took a daring turn suggested that her would-be son would be wedded to heroic accomplishments.</li>
<li>Without caring for the Tungabhadra which flowed nearby and which was easily fordable, she desir ed to sport in the Tāmraparņi in company with her army of elephants that would raise waves in its waters (while they submerged with their huge bodies).</li>
<li>Though she was physically unable to walk as far as the pleasure-hill where the deer were quietly<br>

<li>She heard of Vişnu&rsquo;s miraculous exploits underneath the earth and wanted to imitate Him &hellip;. (slöka imperfect).</li>
<li>She laughed at Śiva&rsquo;s valour in reducing Tripura aided by all such paraphernalia as the Earth for the chariot, Brahma for the charioteer, Sesa for the bowstring, the mountain for the bow and Hari for the arrow.</li>
<li>As time advanced, the limbs of her body began to put on flesh; he face regained its sweet and lazy eye-looks; her beily began to show its folds distinctly; and this change in his beloved filled the king withi delight.</li>
<li>The auspicious line of hair that was on her abdomen looked like a black serpent on guard in order to protect the infant within.</li>
<li>Her breasts, with black nipples, surpassed in their attractiveness the çakravāka couple with a bit of blue utpala flower in their beaks.</li>
<li>The lord of earth regarded her being in an interesting condition, as if she were a rain-cloud full of water within, a pearl oyster with pearl inside and night time foreshadowing the rise of the moon.</li>
<li>The king who was as prosperous as Indra and who was ever bent on the amelioration of his subjects, celebrated the ceremony of pumsavana as ordered by<br>

14. Then on an auspicious day, at the hour pro nounced most auspicious by astrologers, the queen presented her lord with a boy, as Goddess Pārvati bore to Śiva the child Subrahmanya.<br>
15. The quarters then shone with spotless lustre as if they had been newly washed by royal fame which was fit to be likened to the whiteness of milk that filled the milky ocean.<br>
16. Cool breeze scented with the flower-dusts from heavenly trees began to blow gently as if afraid of the new-born infant who was soon to attain the mastery of his earth.<br>
17. The god of fire seemed to dance with joy, describing auspicious circles with his bright ends; and this betokened that fruitful sacrifices would soon be performed all over the southern countries in abundance.<br>
18. The kalpa vřksās by showering down flowers through clouds looked as if courting in advance the friendship of the royal child who was soon to excel them in the glory of giving.<br>
19. The wild elephants, with ichor flowing down their cheeks, trumpeted in joy, as if in contemplation of the destruction that awaited their enemies; the lions, at<br>

20. The horses also neighed with joy, tearing the ground with their large hoofs, perhaps thinking, that they would soon be mounted upon by the child and a great glory awaited them in that role.<br>
21. Tumultuous rejoicings among the people of the city arose, with trumpets blowing and çāraṇas shouting auspicious words.<br>
22. The monarch of Kuntala wished to give away even himself bodily to those that bore the glad tidings of his son&rsquo;s birth,<br>
23. By his royal word of command the prisons were thrown open and prisoners were unchained and liberated as if to make room for future incumbents, viz., the turuskas.<br>

24. Duly bathed and clad in white silk, the king: after doling out immense riches as gifts to Brāmins, entered the lying-in room with a glad heart to see the face of his son.<br>
25. He saw the child lying on the lap of his slim featured queen like a swan youngling on the wavy-bed of the autumnal river.<br>
26 to 30. Rays of light, whitish as camphor dust, played on the child&rsquo;s form which subdued the lustre of the lamps burning in the lying-in-chamber. With his two reddish hands closed, the child looked as if already practising the art of holding within his grasp the god dess of prosperity of his enemies. His two gracefully shaped feet bore auspicious marks indicative of conch,

MADHURAVIJ A Y AM disc, umbrella, lotus, banner, and fish. His tiny fingers, reddish and soft as tender foliage, were also beautiful to look at. He bore the hairy sign of Śrīvatsa on his breast which suggested that he was an avatāra of Vişnu, and, that unbroken prosperity would mark his life. His forehead was adorned with a circle of hair between the eye-brows. His eyes were large like the petals of blooming lotus. His nose was lofty; and a sweet smile played on his red lips. Altogether, the child&rsquo;s face was surpassingly beautiful.
31. Tears of joy, for a while, acted as a check on the steadfast look of his eyes that feasted on the cherubic form of the child.<br>
32. The king embraced the child with his eyes; and the excessive emotion in his mind burst out as manifest by horripulation.<br>
33. On an auspicious day, the jāta karman rites of the child were performed as directed by the priest, and the child grew in splendour like the god of fire that witnesses those rites.<br>
34. The king who always looked ahead named his child Kampana, as he clearly foresaw in his mind that, in proper time, the latter would become a matchless (warrior, and was sure to make his enemies in the field of battle quake with fear.<br>
35. Just as the sacrificer tends the fire with ghee offerings, and just as the cloud sustains the corn with rains, so too, the king had his child brought up by trustworthy nurses.<br>

38. The pleasurable feeling which the king had while embracing his cherub boy, was not to be matched by the contact of camphor, pearl, sandal-paste or moon beams.<br>
39. The king and the queen felt themselves bathed in an ocean of nectar as they enjoyed looking at their child crawling on his knees on the floor of the palace, with the small bells in his ornaments tinkling.<br>
40. Then, in course of time, the queen bore to the king two other sons called Kampana and Sangama who were like pārijāta and çintāmaại that sprang from the milky ocean.<br>
41. The prince (viz, Kampana), along with his two brothers, began to grow, day by day ; and people were in ecstasies when they looked at him as at the (waxing) moon.<br>
42. The king, with his three children, shone like Śiva with his three eyes, the moon, the sun and the fire; or like statesmanship, with its three unfailing aspects, Power, Daring and Counsel; or like life with its three ends, Virtue, Wealth and Enjoyment.</p>

23. “Perverse rogues do not mind the prompt ings of good leaders. They close their eyes in their intoxication. They are unclean because of the dust of sin they raise against themselves. They tie themselves to deep prejudices as if to firm posts. In all this they resemble elephants in rut.<br>
24. &ldquo;The darkness of intoxication such as of youthhood is akin to that of a starless night. Nothing like moon-light awakening can you expect during its sway. It marks the triumph of sex passion and is a bad period of life not easily overcome by one in embodied state.<br>

26. Youth deprived of discretion, and rulers blinded by prosperity, going their own way, soon became the favourites of danger which overtakes them as a night of eclipse does in the case of full moon.<br>
27. Which wise man would trust women who are the abode of ail foibles and who are like nets ensnaring the mind resembling the frolic-blind deer?<br>
28. “All that a gambler has—fruitful earth, valu ablc ornaments, riches, and even his own body, his strength, his wives and his sons—does not belong to him, but belongs to others.<br>

32. &ldquo;Subjects are the wealth of kings. When that is so, who could think of inflicting a reign of terror on them by having recourse to brutal punishments? Nobody would go up a tree and apply the axe to its roots.<br>

26. The wind, blowing from the end of his waving tail which attended on him, was like a disciple taking secret.lessons in speed.<br>
27. By raising his head up, and letting it down again, frequently, to keep his swiftness in bounds, he appeared to be offering salutations to the Goddess of Victory standing in front of him.<br>
28. With the heaps of dust raised by his hoofs, the regions of the sky were rendered like floor; and this served to give the lie direct to the claims of the sun&rsquo;s horses that they trod on airy tract.<br>
29. The king mounted the horse, the personifica tion of strength, and (in his elation) felt as if the entire kingdom of the earth had already passed into his hands.<br>
30. With numberless troops pouring in from all directions, the king, with his view unconcealed, crossed the outer gate.<br>

38. The aggregate of dust caused the illusion of a huge dung heap capable of manuring the creepers of (Kampaņa&rsquo;s) fame that had begun to sprout out in all the quarters.<br>
39. Under the pretext of being hidden away by the dust, the sun (in fact) fled to some unknown quarter, afraid that he might be pierced through by warriors transformed into gods in the approaching conflict. (Warriors who go to vīra-swarga after a heroic end may pierce the sun in their journey to that destination).<br>

42. Water particles sprayed from the trunks of female elephants gave the shape of a fine hail to the cloud of dust raised by the marching army.<br>
43. Particles of dust fanned out by big war elephants flapping their ears were kept back by the rain of spray from the trunks of elephants<br>
44. The army which looked like the grand con fluence of all the seven oceans at the time of Mahā pralaya (the Great Deluge) began its orderly march with a great uproar.<br>
45. Caught up in the temples of great elephants overflowing with ichor, dust no longer rose, though the ground was continuously being broken by the toe-like hoofs of horses.<br>
46. The cool breeze, cool by reason of its contact with fine drops of water from the waves of the Tunga bhadra, proved quite welcome for the onward march of the army.</p>

a close likeness to a collection of glow-worms in the darkness of the dust.
56. Even like the fancied side-glances of the amourous Goddess of fight, the sharp-pointed arrows let fly against one another by bow-men fell to the ground.<br>
57. The blood-stained sword-blades waving in the hands of heroic warriors appeared like the lolling tongue of Yama eager to make a meal of them.<br>
58. In the countless rivers of blood which began to flow on all sides, the faces of soldiers cut off by the bhalla arrow looked like lotuses.<br>
59. The arms of kings severed by swords resembled the trunks of elephants but were mistaken for snakes by the eagles that snatched them away.<br>
60. The blood flowing from human trunks was very much liked by the Rākşasis who deftly seated themselves on the trunks of elephants as if on tops of places.<br>
61. Brave fighters sent to (everlasting) sleep by enemy arrows on the protrusion of their elephants, soon woke up on the pot-like breasts of divine damsels.<br>

68. The sound of his war-drums raised echoes from every cave of the hill and it looked as if the hill itself had begun to yell out in fright.<br>
69. With flags flying in the direction of high winds, the hill (fort) gave the impression that it was greeting king (Kampaņa) and welcoming him with its arms (the flags) to come to its top.<br>
70. Again, fierce fighting commenced between the two sides, and the weapons falling down and shooting up, lit up both earth and sky by their resplendance.<br>

71. Heads severed by arrows resembled palmyra fruits as they fell down from the ramparts and caused an illusion of balls belonging to the Deity of War (for playing with).<br>

73. The hill, with the houses lit up by the fire from the missiles of bow-men, looked like holding lamps in readiness for the happy ceremony of hārati to mark the auspicious victory of the king.<br>
74. The ascent of the hill was accomplished by heroic men by means of rows of lances planted as ladders and climbing up to the tops of sāla trees.<br>
75&amp;76. With all means (and chances) of (escape) coming out completely blocked, the stronghold was subjected to such great distress that the embryos of women, big with children, slipped out at the very sight of the fierce troops jumping in, and people immersed in the river of blood of the slain prayed for their lives.
77. The Sambuvarāya monarch, with drawn sword, came out of his palace in great anger, even as a snake with its lolling tongue might come out of a mole hill.<br>
78. Though many a soldier of valour eagerly came forward to fight saying, “let me do it”, king Kampana preferred to face the Sambuvarāya himself.<br>

79. With the forepart of their bodies bent and eyes fixed, the two kings, sword in hand, stood still for a moment like a picture on a piece of painting.<br>
80. The gods were thankful for the total absence of winking in their eyes, as they were looking on with fixed gaze, the flight (of the two heroes), their bodies divided at the waist.<br>
81. Kampana&rsquo;s sword, reflecting as it did, the image of the Sambuvarāya monarch, looked like a pregnant daughter about to give birth to a husband for the celestial nymphs.<br>
82. Then escaping deftly a sword thrust, king Kampaņa despatched the Sambuvarāya (monarch) as a guest to Indra&rsquo;s city.<br>
83. Having thus reduced (killed) the Sambuva rāya in the field of battle, king Kampaņa received the decree of his father that he should rule (the territory thus conquered). With the fame of his victory duly established in Kānci, he inaugurated a just and prosperous rule over Tundiramandalam destroying all confusion in castes and religious orders.</p>

<li>His prowess was recognised everywhere; his actions were always fruitful. He increased the scope of negotiation among other strategems in achieving his purpose. Highly intelligent and politic, he was. There was something original in his statecraft, which showed he was a real master.</li>
<li>Even as the sun with his bright rays unveils every object on earth, the king, by his skilful employ ment of spies, knew everything that was being done by friends and foes alike.</li>
<li>The system of light taxation which he practised pleased his subjects in his kingdom, and earth herself showed a great satisfaction by her excellent yield of corn and other produce.</li>
<li>Earth, by finding rest on his strong, attractive, ornamented and liberal hands, lightened the burden of Sēşa who was her prime support.</li>
<li>The threshold of his palace was ever thronged with elephants, and also kings waiting for audience. The former made it muddy with their flowing ichor, while the latter made it dry with gem-dusts falling down from ornaments broken as a result of jostling.</li>
<li>Every day kings that had cast off their old enmity rubbed their forehead against his royal foot stool. And their resultant change of fortune suggested the idea that new letters of prosperity were written on their foreheads (in lieu of those that were already there from their birth).</li>
<li>The royal threshold was always beseiged by crowds of kings, such as of Magadha, Māļava, Sevuna, Simhala, Dramila, Kērala and Gauda, waiting for an opportunity to pay their homage.</li>
<li>On both sides beautiful damsels waved the chowri, and in the jingling of their golden bracelet, the voice of court bards singing panegyrics was almost drowned.</li>
<li>Kampaņa loved very much to listen to com positions of good poets in his court, compositions which were sweet like the sounding of Saraswati&rsquo;s anklets as she practised graceful walking.<br>

14. In his hunting expeditions, the king cleared the forest by killing hyenas, wounding buffaloes, scat tering deer, and slaughtering wild boars. He also subdued rhinoceroses and caught elephants.<br>
15. Then summer set in. It made women have recourse to scented snows, fans and sandal. They also loved moonlit nights.<br>
16. Days enjoyed bright and long sun-shine, and nights were short; young women loved to enjoy water sports. Gentle winds, fragrant with the smell of full bloomed patala flowers, blew.<br>
17. By the decree of eternal law, the sun had to leave the southern region, in order to obtain, as it were, the cooling influence of the ice-clad Himālayas.<br>

23. The king got over the heat of the day by retiring with the choicest ladies to his summer-house where water-particles sparkling like stars were being sprayed incessantly.<br>
24. After summer, came winter which the cataka hirds welcomed with delight, and which, by the flowering of nicula reeds, produced the illusion of chowries.<br>
25. Thick clouds began to appear here and there. They looked like the sporting pavilions of women called lightnings; and the thunder that was heard resembled the sounds of mridanga drums.<br>

29. Frozen rain drops fell from clouds that whirled round with the blowing of the eastern wind. Looking at them, one wondered if they were not pearls which were taken along with the sea-water during the latter&rsquo;s formation.<br>
30. In mountainous plateaus peacocks danced singing sweet notes of shadja at the appearance of clouds that were their favourites.<br>
31. Travellers with desperate courage heard the thundering of clouds in the sky which sounded like celestial kettle-drums which Cupid beat with sticks of lightning<br>
32. For some days the forest presented this appearance: Plantains put forth new shoots. Arjuna trees blossomed and also the kadamba and kētaka. Cātaka birds were in great glee, and also the peacocks.<br>
33. Through winds, as if with hands, clouds sprinkled kētaka dusts resembling holy ashes. The murmuring of thunder was like the uttering of hum. And all this was effective in exorcising the evil-spirit of love-anger which sometimes possessed the ladies of the harem.<br>
34. The mind of the king was very much attract ed by pleasure-hillocks. Eyes in the tails of dancing peacocks rendered them very picturesque, and camphor<br>

43. The clouds in winter seemed to have acted like a whet-stone and a wash in the case of the sun and the moon, respectively, for they both shone now with increased brightness and splendour.<br>
44. The rivers were rid of impurities and looked slimmer. And by uniting them with the swans, their lovers, the season really enacted the role of a dear female friend effecting reconciliation between angry lovers.<br>
45. Everywhere there were heard sweet sounds from swans resembling the music of Laksmi&rsquo;s fcet wan dering on lotus-beds or the auspicious sounding of Cupid&rsquo;s tūrya (musical instrument).<br>
46. Autumn, like a beautiful lady with lotus eyes, desired as it were to see her face every now and then in the mirror of the sun whom she, therefore, frequently drew out from his wrapper of white clouds.<br>

turn the mind of anger-ridden dam sels that spurned their lovers.
64. Kimśuka trees with buds of dazzling red shone like lions with blood-stained nails—lions that had torn the deer of lovely travellers.<br>
65. Rows of campaka clusters with collyrium like bees settling on them looked like lamps lighted by the spring in commemoration of Cupid&rsquo;s festival.<br>
66. The sweet odour of wine in the mouths of beautiful-eyed ladies travelled to the vakula flowers from which the southern breeze took it. Thus it had its spreading in an appropriate manner.<br>
67. Asökas, with bees humming around in thick rows, indicated a sort of appropriateness to the manure which the tree had by the touch of the tender feet of Kuntala ladies resounding with ornaments.<br>
68. The kuravakas that looked like hairs stand ing on end in the act of mutual embrace of lovers, raised love passion even in the hearts of insentient beings.<br>

70. Wild creepers that were the beloved of the black bee attracted the latter very much as clusters of buds looking like breasts sprouted in them, in the flower ing season of spring.<br>
71. In the spring festival ladies wanted to paint forms of Cupid on picture-boards. But they ended by painting the form of king Kampaņa who was always in their heart.<br>
72. Certain ladies smeared the Cupid-like person of the king with sandal paste, and their hands evidenced love passion by sweat drops and horripilation that marked them in the act.<br>
73. The tinkling of bracelets, the tossing of girdles, the dropping of garlands and the wying of curis that marked the practice in swinging play, looked like a rehearsal on the part of lovely ladies of love sports with their lover.<br>
74. Some queens felt ashamed before their female companions; and in singing songs in praise of Kāma they often introduced the name of the king in their for getfulness.<br>
75. They desired to splash on the king paste of saffron, but they were not aware that the substance had already leaked out of their sweat-bathed hands.<br>
76. King Kampaņa thus rendered the third end of life (Kāma) fruitful by sporting to his heart&rsquo;s con tent with the ladies of his harem whose passion was not dimmed even in unbroken union.</p>

<li>The sounds of jewelled anklets of ladies, as they seli on the king&rsquo;s ears, produced the impression in his mind, that it might be the noise of the stringing of Cupid&rsquo;s bow.</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>From there he submerged into the waters of the Western Ocean as if to replenish his heat from the submarine fire there-heat which had been spent in the day in making lotuses blossom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ladies of Varuna&rsquo;s harem fancied the globe of the sun to be the golden ear-ring which the Goddess of Day had dropped down in her haste to depart.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The cheeks of Varuna&rsquo;s ladies reddened with the rays of the setting sun; and this change of colour came to them (cheeks) even when no intoxicating wine had been drunk.<br>

ine</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sun, getting drunk with the honey in the lotuses, abandoned ambara (meaning ‘sky' and &lsquo;appa rel&rsquo;) and in that state touched the western region revered as Varuna&rsquo;s queen. Who is there that is immune to the injurious influence of drinking?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sun at one stage seemed to be afflicted with the heat of separation from the eastern quarter; but now he was seen enjoying himself in company with the opposite quarter, his heat gone, on reaching her. The minds of lovers are certainly inscrutable!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lotus ponds with closed fowers of lotuses looked as if offering their prayer with folded hands for the return of the sun who had left them for another hemisphere.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ocean, with the folds of evening clouds reflected in the waves raised by the wind, looked as if putting up steps of gems for the sun to descend from the sky.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The globe of the setting sun, as it touched its own reflection in the waves of the western ocean, raised in one&rsquo;s mind the idea of the Golden cymbals, for the evening dancer, Śiva.<br>
eve</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cakravāka couples with their pitiful looks at the setting sun, and with bits of lotus-stalk dropping down from their beaks, looked very miserable on the eve of their mutual separation at nightfall.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A few streaks of light still lined the sky even after the sun had sunk in the ocean waters. These looked like the remnant branches of the tree of Day which the elephant Time had uprooted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ocean, with the beams of the setting sun, reminded one of the time-honoured anecdote of its having been stained with the blood of Madhu and Kaitabha.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The globe of the sun, with its lustre gone, rolled, scattered by the ocean waves. Sea-fishes licked it often and often, mistaking it for the broken remains of a fruit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Small remnants of light caused hundreds of dark shadows of trees to be cast on the ground. And these looked like the forces of darkness overpowering the army of the sun fleeing in fear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sun, setting out on a journey at the end of the day, entrusted his paritāpa (heat, also distress) to be kept by the hearts of women separated from their lovers, and his brilliance to be safeguarded by herbs (that used to glow at night time.).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taking a warning as it were, from the fall on one khaga (the sun, also a bird) because of his over stepping Visnupāda (the feet of Vişnu, also sky), the other khagas (birds) quietly hid themselves in their nests in trees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within closed petal-doors of lotuses which are considered as Lakşmi&rsquo;s dwelling houses, the black bees going round and round, humming, enacted the role of night-watchmen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Goddess of Day, sealed, as it were, the closed lotuses with the lac of black-bees sitting close on their surface, with a view to guard the fragrance treasure of honey within.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The evening twilight was fancied by people as the screen of the stage where the dancer Time, was about to act the part of Night having taken off his dis guise as Day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The same twilight raised the momentary vision of a red doublet worn by the region of Varuņa; one also fancied that it should have got its characteristic colour by coming into contact with the dust raised by the hoofs of the sun&rsquo;s horses as they trod on the red layers of the western mountains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Red clouds travelled in the evening sky, and their colour was imitative of the hue of the red dye adorning the face of the Damsel, Night, who was about to set foot on the horizon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reddish hues of twilight, as of tender leaves, began to show themselves in the western horizon like coral reefs revealed by the western ocean in the agitation caused by the rapid fall of the sun into its depth.<br>
23 to 25. Then darkness began to set in. now obscuring trees, now the sky, now the regions; and it gave rise to various fancies such as: that they were tender leaves of tamāla with which the regions deco rated their ears; or that they were musk-paste draw ings on the face of the lady called Night; or that they were smokes rising from the quenching of the sun&rsquo;s heated surface; or that they were black bees disguised as darkness filling the regions after leaving the closing lotuses, or the black waters of the Jumna rising up, tall as trees, when disturbed by Sri Krsna.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People&rsquo;s eyes suddenly lost their power (of seeing). It seemed as if the burning lamp of the sun was put out, and from the lamp-pot of sky, lamp-black was being scattered all round.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The stars began to show themselves in the dark sky, and people fancied that God Śiva was letting go his elephant-skin clothing dotted with drops of blood (after his dance was over).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The stars looked as if they were beads of perspiration appearing on the blue sky as a result of its suffering from the burning heat of the sun during the day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Time was certainly the ploughman; the stars were well-washed seeds of grain; the dark skies were fields rendered muddy, wherein those seeds were sown by him in order to raise the crop of moon-light. Such was the fancy in the mind of all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fancy the horizon as a tree. Twilight was the tender shoot to appear first. Darkness was the full grown leaf. The regions were its branches wherein one saw the numberless buds of little stars.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Girls went to meet their lovers at rendezvous. But friends forbade them by their very sighs; that were made aware by the fragrance of breath in the darkness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lamps lit in houses, which were the children of mother night were tended with great care which took the form of oil-fed wicks. (&lsquo;Snēha&rsquo; means oil also, and dasa' wick).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lady Darkness decking her plait of hair with flowers of stars waited for a short time for her lover, the moon, smiling, as it were, with the blossoms of the white lily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then a few rays of the moon, like glittering ocean-waves, were to be noticed in the eastern horizon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The eastern quarter, hiding the moon about to rise, with her pale appearance, looked like a woman big with child of whom she was about to be delivered.<br>
57 36. A portion of the reddish orb of the moon appeared on the eastern region like the mark on the forehead of a beautiful maiden whom that region (of Indra) might be imagined to incarnate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reddish globe of the rising moon looked like the victorious umbrella of Cupid made of red sandhyaka flowers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just as a new king who after the departure of the powerful personality of an old monarch ministers consolation to the world by his gentle levies, so also, the moon, after the splenderous sun had disappeared, pleased the world with his cool pleasant rays.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then the dutiful king Kampaņa duly per formed the worship of sandhya, and afterwards, addressed his queen who was near and whom the world was delighted to call Gangā; thus:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Oh, my lotus-eyed dear, let this hour be honoured by your sweet description. This servant of yours eagerly waits to drink the nectar of your expres sion with his ears.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thus spoken to by her Lord, the queen slightly lowered her lotus-like face in bashfulness, and slowly began to give utterance to her charming words.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Oh, my dearest, see how pleasant is this hour and how propitious to Cupid, with fragrant breeze gently blowing and with the charming moon just rising.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;The lord of night hugs the eastern region to his bosom in an ardent embrace, and with his nail-like rays unties her braid of hair which incarnates darkness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having got up the eastern mountain, the moon looks as if sucking darkness from the cup of sky, his rays acting as lotus stalks to suck through.*</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The moon who is the lord of miraculous herbs, practises alchemy, as it were, by transforming the ‘iron called darkness into the ‘silver' called moonlight, by subjecting the former to a fire-process called udaya rāga (redness of dawn).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The damsel called the Eastern Region draws out her white silk of moonlight presented to her by Night from the conch-white box of moon-globe and dresses herself with it, and looks splendid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The moon embraces with his hands of rays the damsel of Eastern Region, and at the same time, also touches another called Kumudvati (bed of night lotuses). This shows, that lustful men ought not to be trusted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Though the moon touches incessantly with his rays, as with hands, the lotus clusters, the latter do not look up to him nor return his attentions. That proves how virtuous women are firm in their vow of chastity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sun enters the moon every new-moon, and so, the latter is also endowed with the heating qua lity of the former. And this, he exhibits in the case of lovers in separation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bee-black spot that is observed in the centre of the moon&rsquo;s globe is not the sign of deer as some suppose. But what it evidences is the applica tion of lamp-black which he had while being used as one of the wheels of Rudra&rsquo;s chariot at the time of Tri pura destruction.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>In Sanskrit, unlike in English, &lsquo;moon&rsquo; is masculine.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="51">
<li>Or, you may even consider that spot blue as indra-nāla gem, as night herself who is his beloved lying there is love&rsquo;s repose.”<br>
Thus ends the seventh canto of Virakamparāya çaritam, called Madhurāvijayam composed by Gangā Dēvi.</li>
</ol>
<p>The condition of the Tamil country after the Muslim Occupation.
&hellip; &hellip; Verily has become the abode of tigers, true to its name. &hellip; (incomplete).
Wa
In Srirangam the lord of serpents is seen warding off the tumbling debris of brick with his hood lest their fall disturb the sleep of yoga in which Hari is wrapped up there.
When I look at the state of the temples of other gods also, my distress knows no bounds. The foldings of their door are eaten up by wood worms. The arches over their inner sanctuaries are rent with wild growths of vegetation.
Those temples which were once resonant with the sounds of mridanga drums, are now echoing the fearful howls of jackals.
The river Kāvēri, uncurbed by proper bunds or dams, has become deflected very much from her time-honoured course, and flows in all sorts of wrong directions as if imitating the Turuskas in their actions.
The Brāhmin streets, where once the sacrifi cial smoke was ever seen rising, and the chanting of Vēdās always greeted the ears, now exhude the musty odour of meat, and resound with the lion-roars of drunken Turuşkas.
I very much lament for what has happened to the groves in Madhura. The cocoanut trees have all
M A DHURAVIJAY A M
61 been cut and in their place are to be seen rows of iron spikes with human skulls dangling at the points.
In the highways which were once charming with the sounds of anklets of beautiful women, are now heard ear-piercing noises of Brāhmins being dragged, bound in iron-fetters.
Webs worn by spiders have since taken the place of silk veils with which the dolls adorning the outer-towers of the city were once covered. Royal court-yards which were once cool with the spraying of ice-cold sandal, now distress me, wet as they are with the tears of Brāhmins taken as prisoners.
Screechings of owls in worri-out pleasure groves do not afflict me so much as the voice of parrots taught to speak Persian in the houses of Yavanas (Turuskas).
The waters of Tāmbraparni which were once white with sandal paste rubbed away from the breasts of charming girls are now flowing red with the blood of cows slaughtered by the miscreants.
Earth is no longer the producer of wealth. Nor does Indra give timely rains. The God of death takes his undue toll of what are left lives of undestroyed by the Yavanas.
I am very much distressed by looking at the tearful faces of Drāvidas, their lips parched by hot sighs, and their hair worn in utter disorder.
The Kali age deserves now deepest congratu lations for being at the zenith of its power; for, gone is sacred learning; hidden is refinement; hushed is the voice of Dharma; destroyed is discipline, and discounted is nobility of birth.</p>
<p>Having thus narrated the sickening career of the Yavanas, she (the strange woman that appeared before Kampaņa) by her wonderful power of magic caused a terrible-looking sword to appear.
The description of the sword presented to Kampaņa. The exhortation of the female Apparition to Kampaņa to rid Madhurai of the Muslim rule.
In its shining silver sheath and handle, it looked like a serpent that had recently sloughed. In its darkish brilliance it resembled the agaru paste that one might imagine on the person of Bhadrakāli whose advent marks the end of this universe. With the images of burning lamps reflected in its surface, it looked like a fresh cloud bright with lightening within it. This sword, efficacious in drawing tears of sorrow from the eyes of enemies' spouses, she placed before the king, as if it were the personification of the Prosperity-God dess of Cõlas and Pāndyas and began to further address him thus :
“Oh king, in olden times, this sword was made by Viswakarma with the melted splinters of all divine missiles, and he gave it as a present to God Śiva for the destruction of asuras.”
&ldquo;And that God gave it as a boon to the Pāndya king, pleased with his severe austerities. And his successors had it for a long time and were the unchallenged rulers of their earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sage Agastya, seeing that the Pāndya race has lost its old virility by the wearing influence of time, has new sent this scimitar to you, oh powerful king.”
&ldquo;You are by nature daring and wedded to risky enterprises. The possession of this weapon will make you formidable in battle. Forest fire is terrible enough, and if high winds also assist it, who can gauge its all-consuming ferocity?”.
&ldquo;By the wonderful virtue of being armed with this weapon you will never flag in the field of battle; nor would any harm result from enemy missiles such as sword, disc or bow.&rdquo;
“As you wave this lightning-like sword in battie, not even the God of death can dare oppose you, let alone, others.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Do you now proceed to Southern ivíadhura and destroy the cruel king of Yavanas who is the enemy of the world, even as Sri Krsna killed the demo nic Kamsa who once ruled there (viz., Northern Madhura).&rdquo;
&ldquo;Not for the first time will you now be wear ing this bracelet on your hand, which has been (even on prior occasions) the emblem of your vow of protect ing the three worlds, bracelet which none but you can
wear.”
“Do you scatter the heads of Turuşkas, heads with those swinging tufts, those blood-shot eyes, those ferocious beards and furious-browed foreheads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>“May the sun of your prowess in battle wipe off the smile of moon-light from the faces of the drunken Yavana ladies.”
“Dharma is in great distress by being now sub jected to the scorching influence of the evil-natured Yavanas, and earth in consequence looks parched, as it were; and so may you, by the rain of enemies' blood, allay the latter&rsquo;s susserings.”
“May this sword of yours feast the evil spirits such as katüs, pūtanus and yātudhānas with the blood flowing down from the headless trunks of your evil adversaries.”
&ldquo;May you erect many a pillar of triumph in the middle of Rāmasētu by dealing destruction to the Turuşka lord who is wedded to nothing but evil do ings and who therefore is to be regarded as the thorny shrub of the three worlds.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Kāvēri like a tamed female elephant will regain her normal course in the proper pace only if when you become supreme Governor, Oh Your Majesty&rdquo;.

<p>Shlokas 1 to 20: The final battle with the Muslims.</p>

<li>Pearls from the broken heads of elephants in rut attacked by heroic warriors, fell down blood-tinged like sparks produced in sudden collision.</li>
<li>No sooner did a horseman begin to return after having cut with his sword the frontal globe of an elephant than that elephant was seen seizing his horse between his legs and squeezing him.</li>
<li>The blood flowing from the wounded frontal globes of elephants was seen, being drunk through their trunks by some night-prowling demons in great glee, spitting the pearls that also came with the blood stream.</li>
<li>Birds of prey with a view to taste the inner flesh entered into the body of a dead elephant making it quiver; jackals that mistook it for sign of life fled away, though they very much loved to feast on the body.</li>

<li>A certain elephant having seized by the foot, and thrown up a warrior with his trunk, wanted to catch him again, as he fell, with his pair of tusks.</li>
<li>A certain brave warrior thrown up by his adversary&rsquo;s elephant alighted on his back with his sword with which he despatched the enemy rider, and installed himself in his place.</li>
<li>A certain warrior, after having been killed by the rain of arrows of his angry adversary, became a god and from his place in swarga rained flowers upon the latter praising his valour with genuine delight.</li>
<li>A certain warrior was struck with a (double edged) lance by his opposing foe, and by embracing the latter with the same lance sticking in his body, wounded him. This act evoked great admiration. Who is there that is not moved by real exhibition of daring qualities?</li>
<li>Two warriors, meeting in single combat, cut each other&rsquo;s head with their swords after a long fight; leaving their bodies there, they went up together at once to celestial regions as close friends.</li>
<li>Some royal warriors, like lions, wandered in the field of battle, and tore the heads of their adver saries with their sharp nails as if the latter were oppos ing elephants.<br>

<li>With one blow of his sword he (king) split in two both the elephants and their riders with their coat of mail. Their bodies, lying mingled, gave but a slender clue for distinguishing the ranks of elephants from those of foot-soldiers.</li>
<li>The king, by smiting the elephants on their globes, produced many a river of blood scattering the pearls on their head like sands.<br>

<li>One thought, by looking at them, that there was not only one Tāmraparņi river but several hun dreds of Tāmraparnis.<br>

<li>The heads of other elephants he pierced with his javelins and pearis came out from them. This reminded one of Subrahmanya boring a hole in the krownça mountain through which hosts of swans came out.</li>
<li>The agile king cut and wounded the bodies of those that opposed him, even as a hyena destroys. with his sharp nails, deer caught in front of him.<br>

<li>The brave king pounded the turbaned heads of his enemies with his mace in such a way that the eyes which came out of the sockets sank again in their old places.</li>

<li>Not even Parasurāma, Rāma, Bhīma or Arjuna provided such entertainment as the king did to that sage (Nārada) who always loved the sight of good battle.</li>
</ol>
<p>Shlokas 21 to 40: Kampaņa met the Sultan in a duel and kilied him. The conquest of Madhurai was accomplished.<br>
21. Then seeing all his Turuska forces routed in battle, the Yavana king, stringing his fearful bow, met the king Kampa in single combat even as Vritra did the king of the gods.<br>
22. The warriors regarded him as the embodi ment of both anger and intoxication, his eyes red with the drink of vīra-pāna, and knitted brows on his fore head fearful to look at.<br>
23. His jewelled tuft in a line of unbroken bril liance as he rode on his fast horse looked like the wreath of his smoking anger which was about to blaze.<br>
24. The sound produced by his forceful stringing of the bow seemed as if it were emanating from the anklets of the Goddess of Victory, who, after having deserted him so long, was now returning to him in haste.<br>
25. The brave king Kampa delighted in his hav ing an opponent like the Suratrana (Sultan) who had by his valour reduced the Cõlas and Pāndyas and despoiled the wealth of Vira Ballāla (the Third).<br>
26. The two proud opponents fought in a manner befitting the respective might of their arms, by shower<br>
MADHURAVIJAY AM
ing arrows on each other with their bows bent up to their ears.
27. The king of the Yavanas warded off the arrows let fly by king Kampa, which were like the side glances of the Goddess of Heroism. And the king, similarly, checked the Pārasika&rsquo;s (Persian&rsquo;s) arrows which resembled the eye-darts of Yama&rsquo;s sister.<br>
28. King Kampa let fly against the Yavana king his arrows that had, like serpents, drunk the life breaths of Këralas, like fire had consumed the lords of the Vanya Kingdom, and like the sun had destroyed the dark Andhras.<br>
29. The scratches caused by the Yavana king&rsquo;s arrow on the person of king Kampa shone like the nail marks of the Goddess of Victory that was so passionate to enjoy her privacy.<br>
30. The crow banner of the Yavana king which looked like the typification of the crown of Kali age was destroyed by king Kampa, and with that the former&rsquo;s hope of victory also.<br>
31. The king, with his arrow, cut the bow-string of the Turuşka king who was, in his fury, raining arrows at the former. It was as if the knife was laid on the auspicious chord round the neck of the Rājya lakşmi (kingly prosperity) of the Turuskas.<br>
32. The Turuşka hero blazing with anger, then threw away his bow, and hastily drew out his terrible<br>
70
1 MADHURAVIJAY AM sword that was hanging on the side of his horse&rsquo;s saddle.
33. Determined to make an end of the Yavana king, king Kampa also armed himself with that sword which Agastya had sent him, and which looked as terri ble as Yama himself.<br>
34. That sword, grey-coloured like poisoned fumes as it was being waved by the hand of king Kampa, looked like a serpent about to drink the life breath from the Yavana&rsquo;s body.<br>
35. Seated on his agile horse, king Kampa, who was the glory of the Karnāta race, avoiding the sword blow aimed by the Yavana, cut off in an instant the head of the latter.<br>
36. The head of the Suratrāna (Sultan) fell on the ground, the head that never knew the art of cajol ing servant-like, the head that had borne the royal burden of the Turuska Samrājya (Supremacy) and had not bowed down even to gods.<br>
37. The hero, Kampa, was astonished to see that, even after the head had fallen, the trunk on the horse back still held the reins, checking the horse&rsquo;s course with one hand, while the other was uplifted to return the blow of the adversary.<br>
38. On the head of king Kampa, held high in pride, fell heaps of flowers rained from the celestial iegions, and those heaps had the appearance of auspicious yellow-rice (aksata) let fall by the Goddess of Kingly Prosperity, on Her self-chosen Lord.
39. Like the beauty of the forest saved from forest-fire, like the view of the sky after the vanishing of an eclipse, or the calm appearance of the river Yamuna after the eradication of the serpent Kāliya, the region of the South shone after the overthrow of the Pārasikas.<br>
40. King Kamparaya guaranteed the safety of the remaining men in his enemy ranks and was crowned with happiness and glory.</p>
